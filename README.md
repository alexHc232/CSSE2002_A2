This is the second assignment for the course CSSE2002, Programming in the Large, which I completed Semester 1 2025. I hadn't done any java prior to this, 
and the course was also designed to teach good coding principles, and how to create tests for your code. 

The assignment is essentially just space invaders, with an achievement system added as well. We had to identify limitations from the first assignment and add the achievements and tests, as well as write the justification document discussing the limitations and coding princples we implemented. Recieved a 7 for the assignment and overall.
